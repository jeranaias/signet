"""AuditEntry -- the immutable record of one decision.

Every decision the pipeline makes -- *allow*, *block*, *redact*, *escalate* --
becomes one :class:`AuditEntry`. Entries are append-only; once written to the
audit chain they are never modified. Tampering is detected by the HMAC chain
in :mod:`signet.audit`.

This module is data-only. The chain that signs and stores entries lives
separately so this module has zero crypto dependencies and can be safely
imported anywhere.

        type-checked here. A tampered JSONL line that flips ``"hmac": "..."``

        frozen :class:`AuditEntry` whose ``hmac`` is not a string -- and

        verifier instead of the structured ``MALFORMED_LINE`` break the
        chain pipeline guarantees. ``JsonlBackend.iter_entries`` already
        catches ``TypeError`` / ``KeyError`` / ``ValueError`` from this
        method and routes them through :class:`MalformedAuditEntry`.

        Round 23 MED (F-R23-5): the same routing applies to every
        attacker-controlled string slot. A tampered JSONL line that flips
        ``"entry_id": "..."`` to ``"entry_id": [...]`` would otherwise

        emit the non-string ``entry_id`` straight back into its breaks
        array, violating the documented schema contract. Every string field
        (``entry_id``, ``check_name``, ``reason``, ``request_fingerprint``,
        ``owner_id``) is therefore type-checked here, plus ``metadata``
        gets a ``dict`` type-check (a list value would otherwise survive
        ``dict([...])`` only for the narrow case of a list of 2-tuples,
        and we want a clean ``TypeError`` for any non-dict ``metadata``).
        All five rejections raise ``TypeError`` which the backend already
        routes through :class:`MalformedAuditEntry` /
        ``BreakKind.MALFORMED_LINE``.

        ``ts_ns`` additionally has a sanity bound: nanoseconds-since-epoch
        values larger than ``10**19`` would put us past year 2286, which is
        almost certainly tampering and also crashes platform
        :func:`datetime.fromtimestamp` with raw ``OSError`` on some libcs.
