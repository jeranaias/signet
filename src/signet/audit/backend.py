"""Storage backends for the HMAC audit chain.

A backend is a thin protocol: append a serialized entry, iterate previous
entries in order. The default :class:`JsonlBackend` writes one JSON object
per line to an append-only file. Custom backends can target databases,
object stores, or remote log aggregators.

The chain logic (HMAC compute, prev-link wiring) lives in
:mod:`signet.audit.chain` and uses these backends through the
:class:`AuditBackend` protocol so the storage choice is orthogonal to the
crypto.

    the pre-check. The atomic ``O_NOFOLLOW`` guard inside

    Scope (Round 11 INFO): both ``os.path.islink`` here and POSIX
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` in :func:`_open_audit_log_append` check the
    **final component** of ``path`` only. Intermediate directory
    components are resolved through symlinks as usual. The defense's
    threat model is "attacker plants a symlink AT the operator's
    audit-log path" (a co-tenant with write access to the leaf), which
    a final-component check fully addresses. A parent-directory
    symlink bypass requires write access to a parent directory, which
    is a strictly higher capability and a different threat -- in that
    case the attacker can simply redirect the audit log by writing the
    parent directory directly, so guarding against parent symlinks
    here would not meaningfully raise the bar. Operators with
    legitimate use cases for symlinked parent directories (containers,
    chroots, build sandboxes) are also unaffected.

    Hardlinks (Round 14 INFO): hardlinks are intentionally NOT
    detected. A hardlink is a legitimate alternate name for the same
    inode -- the file IS what it appears to be, and ``os.stat`` cannot
    distinguish the "primary" name from any other reference. An
    attacker with parent-directory write access can create hardlinks
    to the audit log, but the same parent-directory-write capability
    already allows replacing the audit log entirely, so detecting
    hardlinks here would not raise the attacker's bar. ``st_nlink > 1``
    is also race-prone (a link can be created between check and open)
    and operationally noisy (legitimate snapshot / backup tooling
    relies on hardlinks). This is the same out-of-scope rationale the
    parent-symlink case uses.

    The chain's :meth:`HmacChain.append` already calls ``last_entry()``
    once per append (cache-hit path), so this backend overrides
    ``append`` to take the lock, re-read the chain head from disk
    (invalidating any stale in-process cache), perform the chain
    update, and release the lock. To make this work cleanly with
    HmacChain's caching, callers using this backend should construct
    their HmacChain with ``cache_prev=False`` (added in v0.1.3).

    Performance: the lock is held only for the duration of one append
    (microseconds for small entries on local SSD). For high-throughput
    multi-worker deployments, consider a database-backed audit
    backend with native concurrency support instead.

        V2 (v0.1.7 follow-up): previously :class:`HmacChain.append` read
        the previous HMAC OUTSIDE the cross-process file lock, then
        called :meth:`append` to take the lock and write. Two appenders
        in separate processes could both read the same ``prev_hmac``
        before either landed its write, forking the chain. The window
        was narrow on Linux but routinely tripped on Windows where the
        compactor's ``os.replace`` raced with the appender's open.

        This method gives :class:`HmacChain` an atomic read-modify-write:

        1. Acquire the sidecar coordination lock (blocks while the
           compactor is rewriting) and the byte-range lock on the live
           log file.
        2. Call :meth:`_read_tail_hmac` to read the last entry's HMAC
           from disk -- guaranteed not to race with sibling writers
           because they're blocked on the same lock.
        3. Invoke ``link_fn(prev_hmac)``. The callable signs the entry
           with the freshly-read ``prev_hmac`` and returns the linked
           :class:`AuditEntry` ready for persistence.
        4. Write the entry under the same lock.

        Returns the linked entry produced by ``link_fn`` so callers can
        propagate the chain HMACs without a second read.

        File-handle layering: the sidecar coordination lock (held for
        the entire critical section) blocks the compactor and any
        sibling :meth:`append_locked_with_link` callers. The tail read
        happens BEFORE the append-mode handle is opened so Windows
        doesn't refuse the concurrent read+append on the same file
        (msvcrt locks are per-handle and an open append handle blocks
        a read on the same path). The byte-range lock on the
        append-mode handle then serializes us against
        :meth:`append_locked` callers that don't hold the sidecar
        lock.
